# OEIS Client Privacy Policy

OEIS Client does not collect any user data, anonymous or otherwise, through your usage of the app.

However, Apple and Google do provide app developers with anonymous, aggregated data about your use of OEIS Client as part of their respective OS's analytics. That is governed by their privacy policies and, therefore, is out of the scope of this policy. You can change your device's analytics behavior in your device's settings.
