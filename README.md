## An unofficial, open-source React Native/Expo mobile client for [OEIS.org](https://oeis.org).

Search and browse the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) easily from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod!

Features:
- Easy-to-use app tailored for a mobile experience while retaining the essence of the OEIS.
- Free to use within the end-user license agreement of the OEIS.
- Use advanced search techniques just like on the website (such as `id:A000045` to retrieve only the sequence with ID `A000045` or `keyword:more` to find sequences that need more terms).
- Tap the link icon at the top of the screen to view the sequence on the OEIS website, or long-press it to share the link.

Neither this app nor the developer are affiliated with the Online Encyclopedia of Integers (https://oeis.org).  All of the sequences and related information are retrieved from the OEIS.
